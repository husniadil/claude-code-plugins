# Provocative Questions Library

Questions to unlock thinking when stuck. Organized by purpose.

## Problem Reframing

Shift how the problem is understood:

- "What problem are we actually solving?"
- "Who says this is a problem?"
- "What if this isn't a problem to solve, but a tension to manage?"
- "What would happen if we did nothing?"
- "Are we solving the symptom or the root cause?"
- "What would a 5-year-old ask about this?"

## Constraint Removal

Challenge assumed limitations:

- "What would you do with unlimited budget?"
- "What if time wasn't a factor?"
- "What if you had to solve this by tomorrow?"
- "What if failure was impossible?"
- "What rule are we following that doesn't actually exist?"
- "What if we had to do this with zero budget?"
- "What would we do if we were starting from scratch?"

## Perspective Shifting

See through different eyes:

- "How would [competitor] solve this?"
- "What would a customer who hates us say?"
- "How would this look to someone from [different industry]?"
- "What would a child find confusing about this?"
- "If you were the CEO, what would you do?"
- "If you were the end user, what would frustrate you?"
- "What would the press headline be if this failed? If it succeeded?"

## Future/Past Projection

Time-shift the perspective:

- "In 5 years, what will we wish we had done today?"
- "What will we regret NOT trying?"
- "If this already succeeded, what did we do right?"
- "If this failed, what will have been the cause?"
- "What would the 10-year-ago version of this look like?"
- "What would the 2030 version look like?"

## Scale Questions

Explore size and scope:

- "What's the 10x version of this?"
- "What's the minimum viable version?"
- "What if we did this for just ONE user perfectly?"
- "What if we had to serve a million users tomorrow?"
- "What if this had to work globally?"
- "What if it only had to work in one city?"

## Analogy Mining

Borrow from other domains:

- "How does nature solve this?"
- "What's the [Netflix/Uber/Airbnb] of this?"
- "How is this similar to [unrelated domain]?"
- "What game mechanic could apply here?"
- "What would this look like as a physical product?"
- "What would this look like as a service?"

## Stakeholder Questions

Consider all parties involved:

- "Who benefits most from this? Least?"
- "Who would actively resist this? Why?"
- "Who's not in the room that should be?"
- "What would make the skeptic a believer?"
- "Who would champion this? Who would veto it?"

## Energy & Intuition

Tap into emotional responses:

- "What excites you most about this?"
- "What secretly worries you?"
- "What's the elephant in the room?"
- "If you had to bet your own money, which option?"
- "What do you WANT the answer to be?"
- "What are you avoiding considering?"
