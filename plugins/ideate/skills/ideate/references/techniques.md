# Brainstorming Techniques

Optional structured frameworks for when users want more systematic exploration.

## SCAMPER

A checklist of idea-sparking questions. Apply each letter to the problem:

| Letter               | Question                             | Example Prompt                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **S**ubstitute       | What can be replaced?                | "What if we replaced X with Y?"             |
| **C**ombine          | What can be merged?                  | "What if we combined this with...?"         |
| **A**dapt            | What can be borrowed from elsewhere? | "How does [other industry] solve this?"     |
| **M**odify           | What can be changed in form/quality? | "What if we made it bigger/smaller/faster?" |
| **P**ut to other use | What else could this be used for?    | "What other problems could this solve?"     |
| **E**liminate        | What can be removed?                 | "What if we removed X entirely?"            |
| **R**everse          | What can be flipped/reordered?       | "What if we did the opposite?"              |

Usage: Pick 2-3 letters most relevant to the problem, not all 7.

## Six Thinking Hats

Systematic perspective-shifting. Each "hat" represents a mode of thinking:

| Hat        | Focus                               | When to Use                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **White**  | Facts, data, information            | "What do we actually know? What data exists?"        |
| **Red**    | Emotions, intuition, gut feeling    | "How do you feel about this? What's your intuition?" |
| **Black**  | Caution, risks, problems            | "What could go wrong? What are the risks?"           |
| **Yellow** | Benefits, optimism, value           | "What's the best case? What value does this create?" |
| **Green**  | Creativity, alternatives, new ideas | "What other options exist? What's unconventional?"   |
| **Blue**   | Process, meta-thinking, summary     | "Where are we? What should we focus on next?"        |

Usage: Don't use all 6 sequentially. Pick 2-3 based on what's needed:

- Stuck? Use Green
- Too optimistic? Use Black
- Need to decide? Use White + Yellow + Black

## Reverse Brainstorming

When stuck, brainstorm how to CAUSE the problem instead of solving it.

Steps:

1. Invert: "How could we make this problem WORSE?"
2. Generate bad ideas freely
3. Flip each bad idea to find the good idea

Example:

- Problem: "How to increase customer retention?"
- Inverted: "How to make customers leave faster?"
- Bad ideas: Ignore complaints, slow support, hidden fees
- Flipped: Proactive outreach, fast support, transparent pricing

## Random Input (Lateral Thinking)

Introduce random stimulus to break mental patterns.

Methods:

1. **Random word**: Pick random noun, force connection to problem
2. **Random image**: Describe unrelated image, find analogies
3. **Random constraint**: Add arbitrary constraint, see what emerges

Example:

- Problem: "New feature for productivity app"
- Random word: "Garden"
- Forced connections: Growth tracking, seasonal themes, "planting" tasks that "bloom" when complete, pruning old tasks

## Worst Possible Idea

Deliberately generate terrible ideas to:

1. Break perfectionism paralysis
2. Find hidden gems in "bad" ideas
3. Define boundaries of solution space

Process:

1. "What's the worst possible solution?"
2. Generate 5-10 intentionally bad ideas
3. Ask: "What makes this bad? Is there a kernel of good?"

Often the "worst" ideas reveal assumptions worth questioning.
