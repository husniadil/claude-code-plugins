# ideate

A Claude Code plugin for facilitation-first brainstorming that helps users unlock their own ideas.

## Features

- EECCA workflow: Extract, Expand, Challenge, Cluster, Action
- AI as facilitator philosophy (extracts user's ideas before generating)
- Session persistence via markdown files
- Technique deep-dives (SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, Reverse brainstorming)
- Provocative questions library for unlocking new angles

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin install ideate@ekstend
```

## Usage

Simply ask Claude to help you brainstorm:

- "Help me brainstorm ideas for improving user engagement"
- "I need to think through options for the new feature"
- "Let's brainstorm solutions for the performance issue"
- "What are my options for the marketing campaign?"

Claude will first ask for your initial thoughts before generating any ideas.

## Core Philosophy

**AI as Facilitator, Not Generator**

The goal is for users to feel ownership over their ideas. Rather than dumping 20 AI-generated ideas for you to pick from, this skill:

1. Extracts your existing thoughts first
2. Builds on YOUR ideas with expansion techniques
3. Challenges promising ideas as devil's advocate
4. Helps organize and prioritize
5. Ends with concrete action steps

## Workflow

1. **Extract** - Get your ideas before generating anything
2. **Expand** - Build on your ideas (Yes-And, Combine, Analogize, Extreme)
3. **Challenge** - Devil's advocate on promising ideas
4. **Cluster** - Organize into themes
5. **Action** - Concrete next steps for selected ideas
